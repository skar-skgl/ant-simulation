# Ant Simulation in Unity

A comprehensive simulation of ant behavior and ecosystems using Unity.

## Overview

This project aims to create a realistic and interactive simulation of ant colonies. Leveraging Unity's powerful engine, we've crafted a detailed environment where ants search for food, communicate with pheromones, and combat threats.

## Features

- **Realistic Ant Behavior**: Ants communicate through pheromones, search for food, and bring it back to their nest.
- **Interactive Environment**: Introduce threats or extra food and watch how the colony responds.
- **Visualization Tools**: Observe pheromone trails, ant health, and other critical parameters in real-time.
